# My Burp Suite Starter Configuration for Fellow Beginners

Hey everyone!

If you're new to Burp Suite like me, you probably know how overwhelming the default settings can be. I was getting lost in a sea of requests for images, CSS files, and fonts, and I felt like I was missing the important stuff.

I decided to dig into the project settings and create a simple configuration that helps me focus on what actually matters for finding bugs. I'm sharing it here in case it can help other people who are just starting their cybersecurity journey.

### What This Configuration Does (Why I Made It)

My goal was to make Burp less noisy and more focused. This isn't a super advanced setup, but it's a huge improvement over the default for me.

*   **🎯 Focuses on What Matters:** It's set to only log traffic that's in your defined scope. This was the biggest thing for me. No more junk from other websites I have open!
*   **🧹 Cleans Up the History:** It filters out most images, CSS, and fonts so your Proxy history is much cleaner and easier to read.
*   **🔍 Finds Interesting Things Faster:** It's set to only show requests that have parameters. Since this is where most vulnerabilities are found, it helps me zoom in on the most important requests.
*   **✨ Highlights Keywords:** It will automatically highlight any responses that contain words like `error`, `exception`, `invalid`, `token`, or `csrf`. This has helped me spot potential issues at a glance.
*   **🔨 Makes Manual Testing a Bit Easier:** I've included a few rules that automatically remove common security headers (`CSP`, `X-Frame-Options`). This just saves a step when I want to test for things like Clickjacking.

### How to Use It

1.  Download the `projectsetting.json` file from this repository.
2.  In Burp Suite, go to the **Project** menu.
3.  Select **Project settings** > **Load project settings**.
4.  Choose the file you just downloaded.
5.  That's it! Your Burp project will now use these settings.

### This is Just a Starting Point!

I'm still learning every day, and this configuration is what's helping me right now. It's definitely not the "perfect" or "most advanced" setup, but I think it's a great first step away from the defaults.

### Let's Make It Better Together!

This is where I need your help! If you're a more experienced user and have suggestions, or if you're a beginner and find something that could be improved, **please let me know!**

You can open an "Issue" on this GitHub repo with your ideas, or suggest changes. I'd love to learn from you and build an even better configuration that we can all share.

Thanks for checking this out, and happy hunting!
